# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game

This is my Python version of the famous game: Tic Tac Toe.

It consists of 4 modules:
  1. main.py: Contains the main class where the methods for creating the game windows are executed. In this class, the function contained in home.py is called first.
  2. home.py: Define the function for the objects inside the home window. 
  3. game.py: Contains the function for defining the objects of the game window. In this case buttons were used to simulate the spaces for X and O. 
              In another function, the turns of both players are accumulated and the symbol corresponding to each button pressed is controlled by another function.
              Finally, a function is defined to match the game with the possible winning combinations, update the players' marker and execute the message and button cleaning functions.
  4. message.py: Contains the class that defines the methods to display a window with a rankedmatch or win message.
